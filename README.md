# vickiMorav
eCommerce mobile app for Android/IOS. Written in Angular, deployed on both Google Play Store and IOS store.

## Project Background
Customer wanted a mobile application for their small business (www.vickimorav.com), to be ran on both Android and IOS. I chose Ionic to deploy this app for its multiplatform compilation.

## How it works
The app communicates to the already provided backend through GraphQL API calls(Products, customers, etc.).
State management, specifically the shopping cart, is implemented through Redux design pattern.

## Source code
This repository is for tracking the overall project, and only parts of the source code is shown. The actual repository is private. Contact me if more information on the source.
